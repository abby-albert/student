## Week 3 Exit Ticket
- We were able to install everything that we needed to, but we did run into problems. I had to go to office hours to fix my make, but the teacher helped me fix it. We wanted to do our live review, but did not get a chance to. However, were were ready to present whenever the teacher was ready for us.
