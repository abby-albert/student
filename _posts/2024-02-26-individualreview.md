## Condensed Project Overview:
Our project is a version of cool math games, and we created it as such because there are many of these fun games that are blocked on school wifi. We created games that wouldn't be blocked. There are 4 games, and two of them are chemistry related to help those who want to memorize elements of the periodic table. The games are Flappy Bird, 2048 Elements, Memory Match, and Tetris. 

## My Feature
I created two parts of the project, the login page and the 2048 Elements. The login is a database where user information is saved, so when a user wants to acsess their highscores and play their favorite games, they can do so. The 2048 Elements is a game where there is a 4x4 grid and your objective is to merge two of the same element together all the way up to get Magnesium. This is done by two of the same elements merging together to creat one element that is one higher on the periodic table. You get two points for merging the two lowest together, hydrogen, 4 points for merging the second lowest together, helium, 8 points for merging the third lowest together, lithium, etc.. This will add up to the total score for your game, and when you get a new high score that will save.

| College board Requirements | Me |
| -------------------------- | -- |
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file. | Our project has a user put in their login and output is taking the user to a page where they could play 4 different games. Another Input is using the left, right, up, and down arrows when playing 3/4 of the games, and the other is clicking the squares. The output would be the object moves in the way it is intended by the user and a revealing of different face cards, respectively. |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collectino of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose. | An example of data collection is the highscore page, and in playing the game, your highest score is stored and you can then see it whenever you're playing. |
| At least one procedure that contirubted to the programâ€™s intened purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters: | This procedure has a name, a return, and parameters: https://github.com/abby-albert/student/blob/c0c7c696c2a8a6ab92e89c786f1ecdf03466a1fb/img1individualreview.png |
| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure | This function shows the sequencing, selection, and iteration through a list of different user ids: https://github.com/abby-albert/student/blob/c0c7c696c2a8a6ab92e89c786f1ecdf03466a1fb/img1individualreview.png
