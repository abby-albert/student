## My Review
- I believe that I deserve a 3.85 out of 4. I have everything completed and organized in the correct spot. Everything runs as well. 

## Alara's Review
- Alara gave me a 3.93 out of 4 because she noticed how organized, creative, and thorough I was with my explinations. She also liked how I edited the color game from HTML to be more interactive using JavaScript. However, I did not recieve a perfect score because she could've explained her code a little more to showcase her understanding.
