### What I did this week
- This week we started off by downloading everything, including VSCode, Linux, Python, Ruby, Bundle, Jupyter, and Homebrew.
- We also made a GitHub and Slack Accounts 

### Hack Prepraration
- VSCode is a code editor that we would use to debug, for task running, and version control. It is an IKE because it is very easy to edit.
- We also made a Slack account, which is similar to Discord, where we can send and recieve important announcements, and also recieve feedback for our problems.
- We also made a GitHub account, which is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
