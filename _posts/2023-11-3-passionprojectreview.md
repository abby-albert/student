# How I Contributed
- I was the main frontend developer, so I did a lot of the homepage design and how everything was organized within our website. The theme, colors, picures, fonts, etc. were all done by me. I also helped my backend developers when they couldn't figure out what to do. I made a ton of commits and I overall feel like I was an asset to my team. 

# What I Created
- Once again, I created and organized almost the entire homepage, including the fonts, colors, pictures, and special characters. I also worked on the grammar bot, the about us page, the calculator, and the flashcards. Other than the things that are displayed on the website, I also created the frontend repository. 

# How The Project Turned Out
- I personally think that our group project turned out really well. I think that our idea was very orriginal and creative, and can maybe help someone out someday. The frontend looks very nice and professional, and the backend works very well.
