    "- A rapidly growing city is facing increasing challenges related to urban mobility. Traffic congestion, inadequate public transportation routes, and inefficient traffic signal coordination contribute to daily commuting issues for residents. The local government is looking for innovative solutions to improve the overall transportation system and make commuting more efficient and sustainable. The city could launch a crowdsourcing initiative to gather ideas, data, and suggestions from its residents and transportation experts. The contributions sought from the crowd could include urban planning ideas, oublic transportation suggestions, and smart traffic signal coordination. The potential impact will include, innovation and creativity, data-driven decision-making, community engagement, and efficient urban mobility."
