## Week 2 Exit Ticket
- We finished the tools check. We were able to use our tools to show the teacher what we accomplished and how we were able to fix the issues that came up. We planed to do the live review this week, however we did not get a chance to present. we did however amek sure that we were ready for the live review if we were pulled to go during this week.
