## <code style="color: #ADD8E6;"> Tools and Issues
When downloading homebrew I had some issues, so exited out of the terminal and reloaded the homebrew webpage. From there I copied the homebrew link again and put it into a new terminal and it worked. WHen trying to type  codes into the terminal, I would sometimes get an error message. But when looking back on what I put into the terminal, I found that I misspelled some things. When working on the blog I had some trouble commiting and syncing the changes to the page. I asked for help and realized that we needed to type something into the space above the commit button and then hit the check mark. I collaborated with my partner very well, and we were able fix all the problems that came up.
